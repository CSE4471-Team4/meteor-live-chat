# Live Chat with Meteor!
A simple live chat app written in Meteor by [Pitchly](https://github.com/Pitchlyapp) that was then destroyed by some CSE Students. For science! The original app can be found [here](https://github.com/Pitchlyapp/meteor-live-chat)

See the [live demo](http://chat.pitchly.net/). Just be nice!

## How to Run
Clone this repo. If you don't already have Meteor, see https://www.meteor.com/install or just run:

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Then in your project directory, run:

```
meteor npm install
meteor
```

Open up http://localhost:3000/ and see the result. Trying opening in two different windows!
